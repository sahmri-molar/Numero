Datasets contain clinical characteristics of 613 patients with type 1 diabetes and were derived from publicly available supplements in

MÃ¤kinen, Ville-Petteri et al. "1H NMR Metabonomics Approach to the Disease Continuum of Diabetic Complications and Premature Death." Molecular Systems Biology 4 (2008): 167


Baseline data:
INDEX         - Patient index.
AGE           - Age (years).
T1D_DURAT         - Duration of type 1 diabetes (years).
MALE          - Female (0) or male (1).
MACROVASC    - Macrovascular disease (1).
METAB_SYNDR   - Metabolic syndrome (1).
DIAB_KIDNEY   - Diabetic kidney disease, i.e. macroalbuminuria (1).
DIAB_RETINO   - Diabetic retinopathy (1).
uALB_log      - Logarithm of urinary albumin excretion rate (mg/24h).
TG_log *      - Logarithm of serum triglyceride concentration (mmol/L).
CHOL *        - Serum cholesterol concentration (mmol/L).
HDL2C *       - Serum HDL2 cholesterol concentration (mmol/L).
CREAT_log *   - Logarithm of serum creatinine concentration (umol/L).
*derived from NMR signal intensity

Follow-up data:
DECEASED      - Alive (0) or dead (1) at the end of follow-up.

Missing values are shown as 'NaN'.
